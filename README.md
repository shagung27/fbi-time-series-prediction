# FBI Crime Time Series Forecasting Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting FBI crime data using time series modeling techniques. It also includes an interactive dashboard built with Power BI to visualize trends and predictions.

## Project Overview

* **Objective:** Analyze historical FBI crime data and build a model to forecast future trends.
* **Tools Used:** Python (Jupyter Notebook), XGBoost, Power BI
* **Main Components:**

  * Data preprocessing and feature engineering
  * Time series modeling using XGBoost
  * Prediction of crime trends
  * Visual representation using Power BI dashboard

## Repository Contents

* `FBI_Time_Series.ipynb`: Contains the complete Python code for data processing, model training, and forecasting.
* `FBI crime analysis Dashboard.pbix`: Power BI file with visual dashboards for crime trend insights.
